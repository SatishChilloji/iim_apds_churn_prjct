Method: 
========
Based on the initial Logistic Regression with all fields, we identified the features that have P value <0.01 (ie. Signficant at 99.99%). We used only those features in  tarining the Neural Network. With the entire feature set, the Neural Network training was not converging in a resonable time frame and hence we used the reduced set of features.We used 'neuralnet' package (Fritsch,  Guenther, Wright, Suling &  Mueller) from CRAN to deploy the Neural Network.  The no. of input fetaures were 27. We used 2 hidden layers with 10 and 3 neurons respectively and used liner output. We tried various architectures so that the training converges in a resoanbley good timeframe. The input dataset was split with 70:30 for training and test datset.

The features that were selected for Neural Network training are as follows:
================================================================================
churn ~ rev_Mean + totmrc_Mean + ovrmou_Mean + roam_Mean + drop_vce_Mean + threeway_Mean + iwylis_vce_Mean + months + uniqsubs + totcalls + hnd_price + phones + lor + eqpdays + fe_mean_per_minute_charge + fe_tot_revenue_per_call + fe_tot_mou_per_call + fe_tot_revenue_adj + asl_flag_N + crclscod_BA + crclscod_EA + crclscod_ZA + ethnic_O  + kid16_17_U  + prizm_social_one_Missing + prizm_social_one_R + prizm_social_one_T
