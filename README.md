# IIM C APDS 03 Customer Propensity to Churn Project
VeriTel is the second largest telecom provider in the world with operations in over 15 countries directly and in other 21 countries with a partner. The company is a leader in providing telecom services in both B2B and B2C space. Although the company has been doing well in last 3-4 years, the revenue of the company seems to have been almost plateau like and stagnating. The CEO hypothesizes that this stagnation is mostly due to a large number of customers churning out of their subscriptions. Given the fact that the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 30-35 percent annual churn rate and it costs 5-10 times more to recruit a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition. In order to manage churn reduction, not only do we need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn, but also we need to know how soon these high-risk customers will churn. Therefore the company can optimize their marketing intervention resources to prevent as many customers as possible from churning. The CEO wants to deploy retention strategies in synchronizing programs and processes to keep customers longer by providing them with tailored products and services. With retention strategies in place, the CEO wants to include churn reduction as one of their business goals.
